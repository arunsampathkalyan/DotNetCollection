<P>
Above all else, the goal of analysis is human understanding of systems
and their problem domains.
<P>
In a recent study  [<A HREF="#grady">1</A>], Grady identified cost components of
software development across the whole lifecycle, including
maintenance and functionality enhancements.  The cost percentages
assigned to the different components stem from a combination of
educated guesses and empirical data obtained from inside and outside
of Hewlett-Packard:
<P>
<table border=5>
<tr><td>
<b>Component</b> </td><td> <b>Percentage</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Program understanding </td><td> 27%</td></tr><tr><td>
Requirements analysis </td><td> 24%</td></tr><tr><td>
Design </td><td> 18%</td></tr><tr><td>
Implementation </td><td> 18% </td></tr><tr><td>
Testing </td><td> 13%</td></tr>
</table>

<P>
Grady estimates that 27% of the total cost must be attributed to
``program understanding''.  This is a separate component from
requirements analysis, design, implementation, and testing.  It
represents the efforts of analyzing what existing artifacts are all
about before remedial actions can be taken in the case of bug fixes,
or, in other cases, before functionality extensions can be performed.
<P>
One may wonder why the program understanding component absorbs such a
large fraction of costs.  A glimpse of an explanation may be found in
another set of data presented in [<A HREF="#grady">1</A>].  Each of the four other
components were further split into two categories: <em> Work</em>, the
effort spent during the first time in the cycle; and <em> Rework</em>, the
accumulated efforts from all the other iterations.
<P>
The following table demonstrates that rework plus program
understanding accounts for 60% of costs.  These contribute little to
the implementation efforts.  Assuming that code size correlates with
coding effort, the code grows as a result of rework by about
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>.
<P>
<table border=5>
<tr><td>
<b>Component</b> </td><td> <b>Work</b> </td><td> <b>Rework</b></td></tr><tr><td>

Requirements analysis </td><td> 7% </td><td> 17%</td></tr><tr><td>
Design </td><td> 7% </td><td> 11% </td></tr><tr><td>
Implementation </td><td> 14% </td><td> 4% </td></tr><tr><td>
Testing </td><td> 12% </td><td> 1%</td></tr>

</table>

<P>
We conjecture that the key to the substantial program understanding
component resides in the initial efforts.  The initial analysis,
design and implementation efforts have the ratio 1:1:2.  We surmise
that implementations start before the task is sufficiently understood
and before a reasonable design has been constructed.  Once an initial
implementation has been obtained, the damage is done.  The analysis
and design outputs are insufficient guides for maintaining and
enhancing the system.
<P>
Grady's account of the cost components is somewhat tentative.  Still we
recommend that the reader go back to the beginning of Part I.
